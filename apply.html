			<h1>How to aply Nordic countries</h1>
			<img src="img/apply-button.gif" alt="apply now"/>
			<p>(Subject to funding availability)</p>
			<p>Norway, Finland, Denmark, Iceland or Sweden</p>
			<p>If you are applying from one of the five Nordic countries listed above, you need to be a team of 4 containing a balance of art and programming students with a team member who will tackle the audio aspects of the game. One of these team members must take on the role of team leader in addition to their technical / creative duties. You must be a team of students (undergraduate / postgraduate) at a Higher Education Institute. You can still apply if your whole team will graduate this year. Your team will be joined by a Scottish student (called an ambassador), increasing the team to 5, in line with the other teams taking part</p>
			<p>All teams will be hosted at The University of Abertay Dundee in Scotland, UK.</p>
			<p>Please note that you cannot enter Dare if you have taken part before. This includes applicants who were successful in securing a place in the competition but who later withdrew from Dare either prior to its commencement or after it started. However you can enter Dare if you previously applied to Dare but were unsuccessful in securing a place (this includes if you got to the interview stage but were thereafter unsuccessful).</p>
			<p>Once you have a complete team, complete the team application form on this site by the closing date of 9th April 2013 at 17.00pm BST (GMT+1). Please note that you MUST include a video pitch of your concept to the judging panel on the application form. To find out more about the selection process please read the "after you submit your application" page. If you have any queries check out the FAQs or our facebook page.</p>
			<p>If your team are selected to attend the interview day, which will take place in Norway, you will be expected to organise and pay for any return travel to the interview location. If this is too expensive for you, attempts will be made to interview the team by either skype or video conferencing, depending on what facilities are available.</p>
			<p>The Scottish ambassadors will visit the country of the team they are joining prior to starting Dare. The sponsored team will receive free return flights and (like all Dare participants) will receive free accommodation during their stay in Scotland. One team will be selected to take part from the Nordic countries listed above.  If you are unsure about any aspect of applying please get in touch with us at enquiries@daretobedigital.com</p>
